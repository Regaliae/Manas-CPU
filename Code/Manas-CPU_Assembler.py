"""
Assembler for the 16-bit Manas-CPU
    - Highest value of instruction argument is 11-bits, 5 bits for instruction code, so 0x7FF.
    - Provide .manas assembly file name or path.
    - Can also include output file name or path as third argument, 
      however this is optional, it will default to "output.manasbin".

Functions:
    - strToInt(number:str) -> int
    - ReadInstructions(file: str) -> list[list]
    - Assemble(instructionList: list[list], outfile: str) -> None
    - run() -> None

Constants:
    - PRG_END

Dictionaries:
    - Instruction_codes -> Contains all the instruction opcodes for the assembly instructions.
